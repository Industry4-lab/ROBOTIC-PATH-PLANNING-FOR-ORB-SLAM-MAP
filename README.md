## üöÄ Introduction
Autonomous navigation systems rely on **SLAM algorithms** to build maps while simultaneously estimating a robot's position. This project integrates **ORB-SLAM** for map generation and **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm** for optimal path planning.

The **goal** is to navigate a robot from a **start position** to a **goal position**, avoiding obstacles and optimizing the path based on real-time ORB-SLAM data.
